# Mobile Phone Price Prediction

In this project, we are going to explore and analyze a dataset which contains specifications of two thousand mobile phones and try to predict optimum price ranges for a list of mobile phones in the market by applying various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and k-nearest neighbors(knn). 


## 1. Data 

We split our data into training and validation datasets and apply ML pipeline on these two. Than, run the most accurate model(knn) to predict target values of test dataset.
